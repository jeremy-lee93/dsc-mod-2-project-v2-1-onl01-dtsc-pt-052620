## What affects the sale price?

asdf

* Price per Square-Foot
* Distances to Points of Interest
* Population Density


### Square Footage and House Price

In order to see how proximity to a point of interest affects housing prices we'll look at the average housing price within a certain interval. We'll use 5 mile intervals starting at 0 miles and ending at 30 miles. By looking at the average housing price in each interval we should see a trend similar to what was shown in the scatter plots above.

#### Square Foot Map

### How does proximity to different points of interest  in King County affect housing prices? 

In order to see how proximity to a point of interest affects housing prices we'll look at the average housing price within a certain interval. We'll use 5 mile intervals starting at 0 miles and ending at 30 miles. By looking at the average housing price in each interval we should see a trend similar to what was shown in the scatter plots above.
