## What affects the sale price?

Out of the many factors that play into pricing a home, nothing stands out better than the natural tiers of housing price brackets that occur given a certain location.  These factors will be explored through the analysis of the followinf characteristics:  

* Price per Square-Foot
* Distances to Points of Interest
* Population Density


### Square Footage and House Price

Houses with larger living square footages should have a higher value. However, when considering other factors (especially location) square footage alone can't illustrate a concrete trend in housing prices.  In order to visualize the trends, square footage of homes will be viewed locationally which can then be juxtaposed with the price per square footage of homes locationally to observe any relationships within the data.
